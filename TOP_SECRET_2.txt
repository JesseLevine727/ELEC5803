Utilizing same method used in multiplication kernel: loading data to registers, saving to register and so forth
specific testbench...

Test simple for loop:
Multiplication of vectors/matrices.

End goal is SoftMax accelerator:
	-How to implement simple NN on FPGA?
		-Will need a baseline with no SoftMax accelerator
	-What are the necessary tests and/or extensions to the core needed for this? This meaning NN on FPGA
	-Needed to add multiplication operation to the core, what else
	
Simple CNN w/ MNIST. then show with SoftMax accelerator , faster inference!! this is the goal!
